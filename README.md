# Concept
- Turn by turn
- The goal of the player will be to survive the last Barbarian attack. In order to reach this attack, he will have to transform his initial
  small encampment into the new Rome. In order to do so, he will have to go through different levels of city:
    - Encampment (5-30 people)
    - Small village (30-100 people)
    - Village (100-500 people)
    - Town (500-1000)
    - City (1000-2000)
    - The new Rome (2000+)
    
- When the player will gain a level, new buildings, new ressources and new events will be unlocked.
    
# In Game Loop
- One turn will be one season. Every turn the player will have to make two choices which will have an impact on the big event. There will     one big event per season and it will be positive or negative depending on what choices you make. Your behaviour will be judged with three   sliders:
  - Happy / Angry
  - Security / Crime
  - Diplomatic / Rude
  
- In addition to these events, the player will have to manage different ressources that will influence on these sliders. These ressources     are:
  - Population
  - Food
  - Army
  - Money
